# IoT-LoadSensor



## Configuration

To configure Wi-Fi credentials for the project:

1. Copy `config.example.h` to `config.h` in the firmware directory.
2. Replace `InsertYourSSIDHere` and `InsertYourPasswordHere` in `config.h` with your actual Wi-Fi SSID and password.

Note: `config.h` is excluded from version control for security reasons.
